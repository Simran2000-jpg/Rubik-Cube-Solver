Developed and designed a Rubik Cube Solver using Python as the programming language and OpenCV as the Image processing counterpart.The user will feed the images of all sides of cubes according to predefned way with green, red, orange, blue, white and yellow in the centers of Front, Right, Left, Back, Upper and down Face respectively. The code will take the average HSV values of each of the nine different regions of Interest. Finally our program will develop the optimal solution which is implemented using Live GUI.

**Wow Factor:**
The user can solve and unveil the hidden mystery of the Rubik's Cube through this automated Robotic project. Adding on to it, this project is also a step by step tutorial guide for the people who want to actually learn how to solve the Rubik's cube. A person can solve Rubik's cube manually as well as virtually by following the simple guiding rules of this project. Thus, the project can serve both as a Automated Robotic Solver as well as a manual tutorial guide for solving Rubik's cube in the long run.
